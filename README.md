# Dutch Treat

Dinner and a Movie at your finger tips!

## Overview

Dutch Treat was designed to take the guess work out of what to cook, and what to watch for your at home Date Night. Instead of debating for an hour about what to cook/watch, simply select a genre and have a movie and a recipie to go along with it in seconds.

- The Movie will also suggest where you can rent/buy/stream the generated movie result
- The Recipie links you to the a site with step by step instructions on how to prepare the meal
